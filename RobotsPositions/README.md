This project's purpose is return robots position

If I were to have more time: 
	I would have added validation to the input of the problem
	I would have added unit tests
	I would have writed function to get string as coordinates of the rectangular world and robot positions and instructions (two lines per
		robot). A position consists of two integers specifying the initial coordinates of the robot and
		an orientation (N, S, E, W), all separated by whitespace on one line
		function will print out the output foreach robot the x coordinate y coordinate orientation and if it's lost it will print LOST in the end.
